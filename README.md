# Mission

As a designer and professional organizer, my mission is to be your champion when your belongings or space has overwhelmed you. My goal is to make every space a unique, organized and well designed environment. We will work together to organize, modernize and pare down your belongings; to turn your space into a clean and functional home. We will take an honest look at your aspirations and create a space where they can be realized. Whether we tackle one closet, one room or an entire house, I will help you reach those goals and stay on budget. It will be a messy and creative process, full of problems to be solved, but I will help you create, design and execute your dream space.

# Services

My services range from the macro to the micro. I work on entire home renovations, closet organization, moving projects, and everything in-between. We can clean, organize and rearrange your existing possessions or start from scratch, or a mixture of the two. Initial consultations are free. So let’s talk and figure out how best we can work together.

# Projects

## Park Slope Basement Apartment

On a sleepy street in Park Slope, Brooklyn, there sits a turn of the century Townhouse. In it’s basement there was half a centuries worth of junk. Over the course of several months I helped the lovely ladies who live there turn this dingy, cluttered mess into a livable gem of an apartment. Where once lay boxes of trash and piles of forgotten items, now is a clean, modern and comfortable apartment. This was a massive project where we first organized, donated and threw out years of accumulated possessions. Next the space was painted, cleaned and renovated. Finally we juxtaposed the old with the new and designed the space to accommodate real life rather than dusty memories.
